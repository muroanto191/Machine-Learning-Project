# Machine-Learning-Project
For my project I went along with a medical data sheet with a multitude of information such as age,bmi,smoker or non smoker,if they had any childern,region, and etc..
For my purposes I wanted to see the correlation between age,bmi and how they related to medical cost. As for my finding I found out the older the age and higher bmi tend to lead to higher medical cost. 
Now what I failed to realize was how also smokers played into these two factors. Smokers tend to also have higher medical cost but lower bmi. Meaning that those who were smokers would go unnoticed. 
As bold as my statement may be, I still considered the older age to be more reason for higher medical cost.
